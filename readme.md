# Algorithms in Javascript

### **Installation**
1. Clone repositoy
2. npm run install
<br />
<br />

### **Interactive Binary Search**
Binary search is an interactive algorithm to find a target value position. This search is achieved by splitting the array in half and discarding the other half that is either lower or higher than the target.

**File:** interactiveBinarySearch.mjs
<br/>
**Run:** npm run interactive-binary-search
<br/>
<br/>
### **Recursive sum**
The recursive sum is an algorithm that calls itself to sum an array of numbers. Its base case is an empty array.
Slice is chosen because it returns a copy of the modified array.

**File:** recursiveSum.mjs
<br/>
**Run:** npm run recursive-sum
<br/>
<br/>
### ***Future improvements***
* Unit tests
* Peer reviews

### **Quicksort**
Quicksort is an array sorting algorithm that falls into the category of divide and conquer algorithms. A pivot is selected, and the array is split into two smaller collections that are either smaller or bigger than the pivot. These steps are called recursively until the array is empty.

**File:** recursiveQuickSort.mjs
<br/>
**Run:** npm run recursive-quicksort
<br/>
